This repo is one of my attempts at the WildLife Tracker exercise.

I messed around a lot with CSS/SCSS and html layout of the pages and had intentions of the root page having some animation to it which is not in this current file.

Overall:I was just trying to make my own buttons and have them be functional links, have CRUD for the sightings,  and make the regions functional(unsuccesfully).

I would like to have made link to a form rendered as a modal instead of bringing the user to a new page and standardizing the layouts between pages.
